            You can send the review requests with the Buyer-Seller Messaging system in your Seller Central account. This
            feature allows sellers to customize their messages.

            However, it's necessary to follow all the platform's guidelines for communication with buyers. So, it’s
            better to check the policies on how to get good reviews on Amazon before sending direct messages.

            In this case, Amazon sends the message with a review request by itself on behalf of the seller upon their request. The seller can’t change or customize the message.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's automatically translated into the customer's language of preference. You can send requests manually from Order Details in your Seller Central account or use third-party software to automate the whole process. Amazon sellers have been receiving outstanding results with this type of messaging. After implementing this tool, recent research among Amazon customers showed a 41% increase in the average review rate per day.

            Additionally, sellers can use third-party software, like SageMailer, that connects with the platform's API. Such tools allow sellers to send customized review requests using Buyer-Seller Messaging templates and automate Amazon’s “Request a Review” button requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the chosen messaging method, Sagemailer's scheduling and automation features will save tons of your valuable time, help you get more reviews, and improve your performance on Amazon.
