        <p>If you are looking for ways to get feedback on Amazon, feel free to send proactive messages to request product reviews and seller feedback scores. The platform has different ways to contact customers to leave feedback: the Buyer-Seller Messaging system, the Request a Review button, and the Amazon API. In addition, a lot of sellers employ third-party apps to automate the requesting reviews process. </p>

            However, it's necessary to follow all the platform's guidelines for communication with buyers. So, it’s

            However, it's automatically translated into the customer's language of preference. You can send requests manually from Order Details in your Seller Central account or use third-party software to automate the whole process. Amazon sellers have been receiving outstanding results with this type of messaging. After implementing this tool, recent research among Amazon customers showed a 41% increase in the average review rate per day.
